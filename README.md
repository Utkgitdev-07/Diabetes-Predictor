# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project is a Flask web application for predicting diabetes using various machine learning techniques. The best-performing model, a decision tree, has been implemented for training our diabetes predictor.

## Project Structure

- `dataset/` - Contains the dataset files.
- `model/` - Contains the trained model `.pkl` files.
- `notebook/` - Contains Jupyter notebooks used for model training and evaluation.
- `templates/` - Contains HTML templates for the Flask application.
- `app.py` - The main Flask application file.
- `data.json` - Contains additional data used by the application.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Utkgitdev-07/Diabetes-Predictor.git cd diamond-price-prediction

### Step 2: Install the required packages
Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt


### Step 3: Run the Flask application
To start the Flask application, run:

python app.py


### Step 4: Access the Flask application
Open a new tab in your browser and paste the following URL:
https://{your_url} for home page and https://{your_url}/predictdata for prediction
Replace {your_url} with your specific URL.


### Project Details

* Notebooks

Decision Tree - Contains the decision tree model.

Naive Bayes - Contains the naive bayes model.

SVM - Contains the support vector machine model.

Logistic Regression - Contains the logistic regression model.


### Model Evaluation
Among all the techniques, we found that the decision tree performed the best for our diabetes predictor model.
