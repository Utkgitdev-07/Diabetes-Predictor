# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project is a Flask web application for predicting diabetes using various machine learning techniques. The best-performing model, a decision tree, has been implemented for training our diabetes predictor.

## Project Structure

- `dataset/` - Contains the dataset files.
- `model/` - Contains the trained model `.pkl` files.
- `notebook/` - Contains Jupyter notebooks used for model training and evaluation.
- `templates/` - Contains HTML templates for the Flask application.
- `app.py` - The main Flask application file.
- `data.json` - Contains additional data used by the application.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a virtual environment
